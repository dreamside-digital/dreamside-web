For a few years I was making all of my client websites on a Gatsby frontend and Firebase backend, with a React component library for inline content editing. This was before Gatsby Cloud, and I ended up writing my own little server to build and deploy the Gatsby sites to Firebase hosting. 

Overall it was a pretty great setup and it allowed me to offer clients a fast and secure website that they could edit and publish themselves, with zero hosting costs. For me, the developer experience was pretty great as I liked working in React and having total design freedom, and Firebase offered all the backend infrastructure I needed for those projects.

Then Next.js came along, and Webflow came along, and I decided to move on from Gatsby. But I still had that pesky server hanging around to build the old Gatsby sites, needing to be maintained, costing me money every month. 

So I decided to move all the builds to Google Cloud Build. It's pretty straightforward, but it did take a bit of fiddling so I'm documenting it here. 

## What are we working with here?
For the project this tutorial is based on, it's a Gatsby v2 site with a Firebase backend: I'm using Firestore, Authentication, Functions, and Hosting. 

## 1. Set up a Cloud Build Trigger

You'll need a Google account with billing enabled. The first 2,500 build minutes per month are free, so if even if you're doing a couple builds a day you shouldn't incur any costs. 

- In Google console, enable the [Cloud Build API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/cloudbuild.googleapis.com)
- Go to [Cloud Build > Triggers](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers) and create a new trigger
- In the form to create the trigger, select "Webhook event" for the Event. You'll need to generate a secret or add your own. 
- Copy the webhook URL preview
- Connect the repository for your Gatsby site
- Create a cloudbuild.yaml file. 
For example:
```
steps:
  - name: node:12.22.12
    entrypoint: yarn
    args: ["install"]
  - name: node:12.22.12
    entrypoint: yarn
    args: ["build"]
  - name: "node:12.22.12"
    entrypoint: "./node_modules/.bin/firebase"
    args: ["deploy", "--project", "$PROJECT_ID", "--token", "$_FIREBASE_TOKEN"]

```
- In the Advanced section, add a substitution variable called `_FIREBASE_TOKEN` and save your Firebase token there - you can generate one with the Firebase CLI command `firebase login:ci`. 
- Create the trigger!

## Create a Firebase function to securely invoke the trigger

- If you haven't already, install the Firebase CLI (globally) and log in:
```
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
```
- create a directory for your Firebase functions
- in that directory, run `firebase init`
  - select `functions`
  - select existing Firebase project

In the new `functions` directory that has been created, go into the index.js file and write the function to call the Cloud Build webhook. 

This is what my function looks like:

```js

const {onCall, HttpsError} = require("firebase-functions/v2/https");
const {setGlobalOptions} = require("firebase-functions/v2");

const logger = require("firebase-functions/logger");
const {defineString} = require("firebase-functions/params");

const {initializeApp, applicationDefault} = require("firebase-admin/app");
const {getFirestore} = require("firebase-admin/firestore");

const webhookUrl = defineString("WEBHOOK_URL");

const app = initializeApp({
  credential: applicationDefault(),
  projectId: process.env.PROJECT_ID,
});

exports.triggerBuild = onCall(async (request) => {
  // Checking that the user is authenticated.
  if (!request.auth) {
    throw new HttpsError("failed-precondition", "The function must be " +
            "called while authenticated.");
  }

  try {
    const db = getFirestore(app);
    // Authentication / user information is automatically added to the request.
    const uid = request.auth.uid;
    const doc = db.doc(`/users/${uid}`);
    const user = await doc.get();
    const userData = user.data();

    // Authorization 
    if (!userData.isAdmin) {
      throw new HttpsError("permission-denied", "You do not have " +
        "sufficient permissions to publish the website");
    }

    const url = webhookUrl.value()
    logger.info(`URL: ${url}`);

    const res = await fetch(url, {
      method: "POST",
      body: {"data": null},
    });

    logger.info(res);

    return {response: res};
  } catch (error) {
    throw new HttpsError("unknown", error.message, error);
  }
});

```

Don't forget to create an .env file at the root of the `functions` directory with your variables:
```
WEBHOOK_URL=<the webhook URL from the Cloud Build trigger>
PROJECT_ID=<your Firebase project id>
```

Deploy your function:
```js
firebase deploy --only functions
```

You can then head over to your Firebase console to grab the request URL for the function!
