Shay is a multi-disciplinary software developer with a decade of experience in full-stack web development, web design, graphic design, online communications, and project management.

She is passionate about creating meaningful impact with technology, which has taken her career on interesting turns from a UN agency in Dakar to a fintech startup in Barcelona to a health tech company in Toronto. 

In 2018, she co-founded Nomadic Labs, a small digital agency committed to working with nonprofits and social enterprises. In 2024, Nomadic Labs rebranded as Dreamside Digital, with a renewed vision for creating digital products that engage and empower communities and enable organizations to accelerate their impact.
