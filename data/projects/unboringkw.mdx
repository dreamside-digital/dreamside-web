Unboring KW is a personal project for fun and community! 

During my maternity leave in 2022, I discovered how easy it is to become isolated as a parent, despite living in a growing city with lots of events and things to do. I found it difficult to keep track of all the programs and events put on by the City, local libraries, businesses, and community centres. So as I was getting ready to go back to work, I created Unboring KW as a way to rediscover my passion for web development and also to solve the problem that I and many other parents have of staying engaged in the community with our kids in tow! 

Unboring KW is a mobile-friendly website that includes:

- family-friendly event listings
- directory of activities to do in the region
- interactive maps of local playgrounds, splashpads, and public art
- directory of summer camps
- a blog

As time goes on I plan to add more features to the website, such as:

- a business directory of local businesses targeting families and kids
- user accounts so people can bookmark resources and create their own collections
- email newsletters and notifications so people can get reminded about upcoming events

### The technical stuff

Currently the key components of Unboring KW are as follows:

- progressive web app (PWA) built with Next.js
- [Directus](https://directus.io/) back end for content management
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) database
- Custom scrapers on [Apify](https://apify.com/) to scrape events from various sources
- Edge functions on Supabase to transform scraped events and insert them to the database
