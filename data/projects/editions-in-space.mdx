Éditions in Space was founded by Prachi Khandekar, an independent artist and curator based in Montreal.  

I collaborated with Prachi to design and build this website as a working prototype of the platform. We worked with another designer who conducted user research workshops to understand the needs of artists, and an illustrator who created the artwork. My role was to establish the general UX of the website and build out the core features. This includes a user-friendly backend where website admins can manage users, content, and automations. 

### The technical stuff

The website is a custom Next.js site built on a Directus backend and Postgres database.
