This project was a beautiful community effort that involved neighbours of all ages in the Cherry Park neighbourhood. We created a theatre group and put on a play, all within the course of a few months and with the contributions many talented individuals from our community. 

My contribution consisted of the design work for the posters, t-shirts, programs, and other printed materials. I created custom illustrations representing some of the main characters from the play (the Sun and the Jester) to feature in the designs.
