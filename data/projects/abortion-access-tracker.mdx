The Abortion Access Tracker is a joint initiative of the Womenâ€™s Legal Education & Action Fund (LEAF) and Action Canada to document and discuss the state of abortion access in Canada. 

My role was to design and develop the website, including a number of features such as a citation system, pop-up annotations, and interactive data visualizations. I also created the graphics used on the website. 

The website is built in Webflow using the Webflow CMS, so it is easy and accessible to update the content and data. 

### The technical stuff

The website is built in Webflow using the Webflow CMS. It includes a custom React component for the "Access at a Glance" section that pulls data from the CMS and displays it in an interactive table.
