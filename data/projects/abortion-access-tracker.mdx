The Abortion Access Tracker is a joint initiative of the Womenâ€™s Legal Education & Action Fund (LEAF) and Action Canada to document and discuss the state of abortion access in Canada. 

My role was to design and develop the website, including a number of features such as a citation system, pop-up annotations, and interactive data visualizations. I also created the graphics used on the website. 

The website is built in Webflow using the Webflow CMS and the localization plugin, so it is easy and accessible to update the content, data, and translations.

### The technical stuff

The website is built in Webflow using the Webflow CMS. It includes a custom React component for the "Access at a Glance" data table that pulls data from the CMS and displays it in an interactive table. 

I have two blog posts related to this project:
