Gift Explorer is a component of Imagine Canada's Grant Connect platform. It gives users a way to intuitively search and filter through decades of data on charitable giving in Canada. 

A previous version of the dashboard had been created in Looker Studio but it was difficult to navigate, slow to load, and had limited functionality. As a result, users were not enaging with it. Imagine Canada wanted to redesign the dashboard and develop it as a native feature of Grant Connect. 

I worked with Imagine Canada to interview users about their fundraising needs, their experience of the previous dashboard, and how the new dashboard could best support their preferred workflows. Based on the user research, I designed a new dashboard in Figma and built out a functional prototype in React. I consulted with their development team to ensure that the prototype was easy to integrate into the existing platform and followed their code conventions. 

The prototype has already been launched as a component of Grant Connect and has been well received by the Imagine Canada team and users of Grant Connect. 

### The technical stuff

The prototype was built in React using the Material UI library and the open-source Material React Table component. Styling is done in CSS Modules and Tailwind CSS, conforming to the platform's existing design system.
