Feminist Law Reform 101 is an open access course developed by the National Association of Women Lawyers (NAWL) that is taught at the University of Ottawa. All of the course materials are housed on the website, including various multimedia resources. The website includes original graphics created for the course, and is built with an intuitive content editing system so the course can be easily updated as the materials evolve. 

### The technical stuff

The website uses Gatsby on the frontend and Firebase and AWS on the backend. We used a React content editing library for a seamless editing experience.
