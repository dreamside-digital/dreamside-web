The BMW Foundation came to us at the concept stage for a new initiative they were spearheading called RISE Cities. We worked together to create a cohesive visual identity that ties into the Foundation brand, yet stands on its own. We then built a website that allows the Foundation staff to edit and update content easily, which includes events, articles, profiles, and more.

### The Technical Stuff

The website uses Gatsby for the front-end and Firebase for the backend. We used a custom content editing library built in React that allows for inline editing, giving the website editors an intuitive and seamless editing experience.
